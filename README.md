Hello User!
	Welcome to my first Project at Skill Distillery. Below you will find basic instructions on how to operate the program.

## Technologies/Skills Used

* Java
* Eclipse
* Google (A lot of this)
* While loops
* If else statements


## Lessons Learned

Overall I felt pretty good approaching this project. A lot of the concepts I used were taught in class and I felt that I wasn't way out in left field during this. I think its fascinating how many different ways you can accomplish the same goal and how different people may think of new and interesting ways to do the same project.

## How to operate the MakeChange program.

When you first start the project and run it you will be greeted by the program. First you must enter the cost of the item you are purchasing. After that you will be prompted to provide how much you are paying. It will then tell you how much of each denomination you are receiving back!
